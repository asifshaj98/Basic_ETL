# University Data ETL Example

This project demonstrates a basic Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process for university data using Python. The data is extracted from the universities API, transformed into the desired structure, and loaded into a SQLite database.

## Overview

The project consists of three main steps:
1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from the universities API.
2. **Transformation**: The dataset is transformed to filter universities in California and restructure the data.
3. **Load**: The transformed data is loaded into a SQLite database.
